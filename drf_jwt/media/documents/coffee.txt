Coffee can help people feel less tired and increase energy levels (1Trusted Source, 2).

That’s because it contains a stimulant called caffeine — the most commonly consumed psychoactive substance in the world (3).

After you drink coffee, the caffeine is absorbed into your bloodstream. From there, it travels to your brain (4).

In the brain, caffeine blocks the inhibitory neurotransmitter adenosine.

When this happens, the amount of other neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine increases, leading to enhanced firing of neurons (5, 6Trusted Source).

Many controlled studies in humans show that coffee improves various aspects of brain function — including memory, mood, vigilance, energy levels, reaction times and general mental function (7, 8, 9).
