One common argument against dairy products is that it is unnatural to consume them.

Not only are humans the only species that consumes milk in adulthood, but they are also the only one to drink the milk of other animals.

Biologically, cow’s milk is meant to feed a rapidly growing calf. Humans aren’t calves — and adults usually don’t need to grow.
